# Supervisor

A micro js library to emulate erlang supervisor behaviour.

*Work in progress: this is a simple experiment.*

## Usage

Include supervisor.min.js in your web app, by loading it as usual:

```html
<script src="supervisor.min.js"></script>
```

Or with nodejs comming soon.

Supervisor has no dependencies and can be used completely standalone.

## Define worker and reload strategies

```javascript
callMe(function(errback) {
    $.ajax({
       url: 'http://example.org/',
       error: errback
    })
}).max(3) //times
  .seconds(4) // minutes, hours
  .onError(function() {
    alert('too many attempt')
}).run();
```

In this example, the `function` in parameter of `callMe` will be called max *3 times* in *4 seconds* if the errback parameter is called. Otherwise the `function` in parameter of `onError` will be called.

## API

`callMe(function)`: the initial contructor. You have to pass the function to *monitor*.

`max(number)`: define the number of time we have to recalled the *runnable* function. Can depends on the number of fail by seconds.

`seconds(number)`: define the number of seconds where `max` error will trigger to stop the *moitoring*.

`minutes(number)`: define the number of minutes.

`hours(number)`: define the number of hours.

`onError(function)`: if more than `max` number of restarts occur in the last `number` of seconds/minutes/hours, then the function in parameter will be called.

`run()`: start the supervisor.

## Why?

Because I want a standalone library to allowing to repeat an action *a la* erlang.

## TODO

* Introduce a `delay` fun.
* ender compatible
